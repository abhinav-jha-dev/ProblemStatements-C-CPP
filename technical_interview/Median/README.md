# Median
In Maths, finding median is very simple by finding middle value in an array on integers. 

Calculating:
```C++
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       ^
median = 3

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
       ^  ^
median = (((length/2)-1) + (length/2)) / 2
median = 3.5
```

## Problem Statement 1
Find the median of 2 arrays without merging two input arrays and also the need to take linear time.

Input
```
var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
var arr2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10];
```
